INTRODUCTION                               *neovim-set-path*

This plugin adds the directories of all `git ls-files` to the buffer-only
'path'. This let's you use the built-in `:find` command to project-wide fuzzy
finding without having to pull in extensive plugins that come with their own
UI.

FUNCTIONALITY                              *neovim-set-path-functions*

                                           *pathutils#SetPath*
Vimscript function that wraps the Lua code. This is the main entry point. Use
it through an autocommand, or as a custom command, like this: >

    augroup SetPath
        autocmd!
        autocmd BufEnter,DirChanged * call pathutils#SetPath()
    augroup END
    command! -nargs=0 UpdatePath :call pathutils#SetPath()

<

                                           *set_path()*
Lua function that is called by the Vimscript wrapper above: >

        require("path-utils").set_path()
